- Contains all custom React/Typescript components
- Prioritize formatting of existing components in all new components created here
- If an element has 6 or more Tailwind CSS classes, instead create a new class using BEM Methodology.
- Any component using BEM Methodology will use the root element as the Block and any children as the Elements.
