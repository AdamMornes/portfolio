              Born and raised in MN, I spent the first three years of my career at 
              <a href="https://arinet.com/ " target="_blank">ARI Network Services</a> 
              honing my skills with HTML, CSS, and CSS theming while fighting off the cold of Duluth, MN.

            <p>
              While my time at ARI wasn&apos;t the most technically demanding, I
              learned many important lessons about CSS Theming I now consider
              core to my skillset.

            After all that time in the frigid north, I decided to make a major
            change. I moved to 1200 miles south to Austin, TX.

            While in Austin, I got my next job at <a href="" target="_blank">XCentium</a>. I spent the next 7 years in the wild west of contract work.
            Working on projects with technology stacks ranging from .NET and
            JQuery to React and Next.js.
