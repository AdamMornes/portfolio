- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Follow the coding standards defined in the ESLint configuration.
- Ensure all components are responsive and accessible.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, adhering to the defined Tailwind CSS theme.
- If an element has 6 or more Tailwind CSS classes, instead create a new class using BEM Methodology.
- Any component using BEM Methodology will use the root element as the Block and any children as the Elements.
