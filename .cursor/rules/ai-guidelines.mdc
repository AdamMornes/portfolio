- When generating code, prioritize TypeScript and React best practices.
- Ensure that any new components are reusable and follow the existing design patterns.
- Minimize the use of AI generated comments, instead use clearly named variables and functions.
- Always validate user inputs and handle errors gracefully.
- Use the existing components and pages as a reference for the new components and pages.
